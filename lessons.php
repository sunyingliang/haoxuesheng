	The lesson is designed to help students derive the volume of a sphere with a simple experiment using the Water-displacement method.  It begins with an eye-catching introduction of the world's largest helium balloon (held till September 2008) to generate interest in the topic.  At the end of the lesson, a number of examples are given to show how the formula is applied.

The concept of a distance-time graph is illustrated with two scenarios of a bus travelling from town to town.  As the virtual clock ticks, the bus moves and the graph is plotted simultaneously.  An analysis of the distance-time graph in relation to the bus' journeys helps the students to grasp the concepts of gradient, speed and average speed.
