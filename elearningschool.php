                                Teacher reviews resources such as Animated Lessons, Interactive Activities, Assessment, and other resources related to the topic.  He/she may download the Lesson Brief to aid in lesson planning.  The teacher also plans strategies to integrate available resources to make learning fun and effective.  Annotation Tools may be used to highlight important concepts in the discussion or record instructions for enhanced learning.  Assessments in the form of Practice Drills, PMP and Game-based Assessment may be assigned to assess students' level of understanding.  The teacher can also set open-ended questions through the Quiz Management System, create journal writing using the Journal Management System or create worksheets.  In all, students are able to input their working steps using proper mathematics symbols and notations found in the Formula Editor.

                                Learning may be further reinforced through assignments of Learning Experiences and Mathematical Modelling.  The forum can also be used for collaborative learning.
