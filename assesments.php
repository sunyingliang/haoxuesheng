Assessment is vital to mathematics education as it serves as a checkpoint for students to gauge their level of understanding and mastery of mathematical concepts.  Keeping this in mind, ACE-Learning has designed and created assessment questions programmed in different forms and difficulty levels.

       These multiple-choice questions (MCQ), categorized into easy, normal and difficult levels, are used to assess the learner's understanding of a particular topic.  The questions from the difficult level are typical of exam questions.  Every question comes with a full-model solution and the auto-grading feature provides instant feedback on the accuracy as well as the time taken to answer a question

          The PMP is a powerful programme that randomly generates unlimited open-ended questions.  It contains a short explanation of key concepts, and a solution hint to guide learners.
     <br />  <br />
    PMP auto-marks and provides instant feedback.  This allows the student to reflect on any mistake made and prevent it from recurring as he/she progresses to the next question.  A comprehensive report provides information on every student's input, thereby providing teachers with a diagnostic tool to identify students who need help.  Available to students as well, the reports enable students to identify their weaknesses.

          Students master the skill of solving simple linear equations with this PMP.  It is uniquely designed for a student to analyze the steps required to reach the answer. This scaffold-type of assessment prompts a student at an incorrect step - allowing them to correct their mistakes and proceed accordingly.

          Students master the drawing and identification of the graph of a linear function.
        The first set of assessments is designed to equip students with the skill of setting up an <i>x-y</i> table and plotting of points while the second set, which requires them to identify the correct graph when a linear function is given, helps to check students’ basic concept of graphs of linear functions.

Using games to enhance learning is a positive strategy that reduces "test-anxiety". Through games, students master concepts while enjoying the process.
<br /><br />
The games are designed with three levels of difficulty, and a player is given three chances to achieve the goal.  Unlike most online games which show only the player's score, the scoreboard provided displays the questions that were answered both correctly and incorrectly; thereby providing teachers with a diagnostic tool to check each student's level of understanding of the topic.  Players are also able to see their ranking among other users in the game centre.

            	This game helps a player to master the various techniques of Rounding-off Numbers.  The objective of the game is to rescue the female monkey by overcoming challenges. These challenges are questions on rounding-off numbers.  A correct answer would bring the player closer to the goal, while an incorrect one would delay the player.  The time taken to rescue the female monkey affects the bonus points awarded.  Players lose a chance when the monkey falls down the creek.

            This game aims to help learners master the skill of solving simple linear questions.  The player needs to protect the city from robots' attack.  The challenge is to destroy the robots by solving each linear equation that is displayed on top of the robots within a given time limit. In this game, losing a chance is tied-up with a time limit.  Hence, to score more, a learner aims to play with speed and accuracy.
