            With technology advancing rapidly, 21st century learners want to have fun while learning. Making Mathematics appealing and interesting is a challenge common to all Mathematics educators. As a partner of mathematics education, ACE-Learning, in its expertise, has designed lessons to suit the needs of a 21st century learner. <br />
                                <br />
Lessons are designed to cover a range of topics, aiming to help students develop their cognitive and problem solving skills. They provide connection with day-to-day activities and continuity between different mathematics concepts. Visual graphics and sounds enhance the lessons to aid comprehension. Each lesson unit comes with several examples of varying difficulty. The interface is user-friendly and flexible, designed to give students the freedom to maneuver the lessons according to their individual learning pace. <br />
                                <br />
Practice More. Score More! Assessment is vital to mathematics education as it serves as a checkpoint for students to gauge their level of understanding and mastery of mathematical concepts. Keeping this in mind, ACE-Learning has designed and created assessment questions programmed in different forms and difficulty levels. <br />
                                <br />
Practice drills, categorized into easy, normal and difficult levels, are used to assess the learner's understanding of a particular topic. The questions from the difficult level are typical of exam questions. Every question comes with a full-model solution and the auto-grading feature provides instant feedback on the accuracy as well as the time taken to answer a question <br />
                                <br />
A comprehensive report is also provided for you to understand your learning journey. Simply revisit the topics which you are weak in until you master them!

                                The app aims to help students prepare for their Secondary or Middle schools' Mathematics examinations. Most of the revision kits only provide working steps in the solution but not the skill to understand, analyse and solve the problem. We resolve this issue by adding a unique feature, 'Thinking Process', in our app.	<br />
                                <br />
Each topic in the app comes with 3 features: <br />
(1) Revision Notes <br />
(2) Questions with Guided Solutions, including thinking process and working steps <br />
(3) Practice Questions, including answer key, thinking process and working steps <br />
