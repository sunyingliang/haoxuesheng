	Mathematical manipulatives play a key role in facilitating students' understanding of important mathematical concepts.
<br><br>
Combining the hands-on learning power of manipulatives with all the added benefits of computer interactivity, <span class="nobreak">ACE-Learning</span> has developed interactive activities to illustrate and enhance comprehension of difficult mathematics concepts.

              <p> Interactive activities are designed to enrich or extend further the understanding of a topic.  Students are also able to simulate "what if" scenarios.  The activities are also designed to support the "Teach Less, Learn More" programme in education.

        <p>
        	This activity is designed to enrich learning in Geometrical Constructions as applied to real-life scenarios.  It challenges a student to find the location of a block in a map by performing four geometrical constructions consecutively.  The skills covered are construction of perpendicular bisectors, angle bisectors, equilateral triangles and parallel lines.  Hints and instructions are available to guide the student along.  All four constructions are to be completed before the block can be located. </p><br /><br />

        <p>
        	This activity aims to reinforce students' understanding of Simple and Compound Interests; to enable them to differentiate between the two as they relate to principal, rate of interest and time.  Students get to simulate values for principal, rate of interest and time; giving them a chance to observe the effects of having differing values.  Additionally, the graphical representations of values are helpful in describing characteristics of interests.

         	Exploration is one of the powerful approaches in the teaching and learning process.  Engaging learners in activities that allow for questions, making observations and drawing conclusions are effective for concept development.
<br />
<br />
EA which support Self-Directed Learning are powerful 3-step technology-based instructional materials designed and created to make learning experiences more meaningful.  Each EA comes with comprehensive worksheets that guide learners in their discovery of formulae, theorems and properties through exploration.  Dynamic tools that can be used for measuring, animation and hints that facilitate answering, observation and understanding are also provided.
<br />
<br />
In the 'Exploration' section, students are given room to explore and make observations.   As the student follows the step-by-step instructions, the system intelligently verifies a student's input(s) and provides instant feedback.   The student is required to arrive at a simple conclusion based on his/her findings.<br />
<br />
In the 'Understanding' section, students visualize the concept further by observing other cases.
<br />
<br />
In the 'Application' section, questions generated allow students to objectively assess success in learning.

         	This Exploratory Activity aims to engage students in observing the relationship among the sides of a right-angled triangle; leading them to formulate the Pythagoras' Theorem.  With the aid of animation, students are able to have fun piecing jigsaw pieces and doing the reverse to enhance their comprehension of the theorem.

                <p>
                	In this activity, students observe the relationship between angles subtended at the center by an arc and any point on the circumference subtended by the same arc.  An embedded protractor which students can use for measurement and verification provides an additional touch of hands-on learning.
